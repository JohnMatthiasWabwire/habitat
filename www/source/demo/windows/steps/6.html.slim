 h1 Leveraging Powershell DSC in Chef Habitat Templates

 p #{link_to 'Powershell DSC (Desired State Configuration)','https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview'} is a small configuration management engine that ships with modern versions of Windows and can be installed on older versions via the #{link_to 'Windows Management Framework','https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/readme'} (WMF) version 5.1. Many larger scale Configuration management systems like Chef and others now wrap their own resources around Powershell DSC.

 p To leverage DSC in a Chef Habitat plan, you need to do two things:

 ul
   li Create a DSC Configuration file in the plan's <code>config</code> directory
   li Declare a runtime dependency on the <code>core/dsc-core</code> package and use its <code>Start-DscCore</code> command to apply the above configuration.

 h2 Our DSC Configuration

 p Add the following code to a file named <code>website.ps1</code> in the <code>config</code> directory of your plan.

 = code(:bash) do
   |
    Configuration NewWebsite
    {
        Import-DscResource -Module xWebAdministration
        Node 'localhost' {
            xWebAppPool {{cfg.app_pool}}
            {
                Name   = "{{cfg.app_pool}}"
                Ensure = "Present"
                State  = "Started"
            }
            
            xWebsite {{cfg.site_name}}
            {
                Ensure          = "Present"
                Name            = "{{cfg.site_name}}"
                State           = "Started"
                PhysicalPath    = Resolve-Path "{{pkg.svc_path}}"
                ApplicationPool = "{{cfg.app_pool}}"
                BindingInfo = @(
                    MSFT_xWebBindingInformation
                    {
                        Protocol = "http"
                        Port = {{cfg.port}}
                    }
                )
            }

            xWebApplication {{cfg.app_name}}
            {
                Name = "{{cfg.app_name}}"
                Website = "{{cfg.site_name}}"
                WebAppPool =  "{{cfg.app_pool}}"
                PhysicalPath = Resolve-Path "{{pkg.svc_var_path}}"
                Ensure = "Present"
            }
        }
    }
   
 p This is going to configure all application specific IIS entities (app pool, website, app folder) so that the web server points to our application directory and listens on the configured port. The net result is that when DSC finishes applying this configuration, our web site should be browsable.

 h3 Chef Habitat Templating

 p Note that all files in your plan's <code>config</code> or <code>hooks</code> directories are processed by the Chef Habitat Supervisor's template rendering system at runtime before they are ever interpreted by Powershell. Chef Habitat templates use Handlebars syntax to manipulate the final template content and pull in values at runtime that reflect the state of the Supervisor ring environment. The Handlebars syntax uses double curly braces <code>{{ }}</code> for including templating logic.

 h3 Using runtime settings in templates

 p Chef Habitat allows you to reference configuration values set at runtime. These can be helpful in your templates if you need to reference port numbers, IP addresses, or other values when performing business logic during the lifecycle of your running service.
 
 p You can use #{link_to 'runtime configuration settings','/docs/reference/#template-data'} in your templates. These include #{link_to 'user-created configuration settings',"/tutorials/build-your-own/#{current_page.data.platform_short}/add-config/"} defined by you in your config file, or built-in values defined by Chef Habitat.

 h2 Applying the DSC Configuration

 p As long as the <code>$pkg_deps</code> of our <code>plan.ps1</code> include <code>core/dsc-core</code>, we can call the <code>Start-DscCore</code> function it exports from the Powershell module included in the dsc-core package.

 = code(:bash) do
   |
    Start-DscCore (Join-Path {{pkg.svc_config_path}} website.ps1) NewWebsite

 p We will include this in our <code>run</code> hook explained later, but this essentially hides the complexity involved in applying a DSC configuration from the Powershell Core runtime bundled with the Supervisor.

 h3 Hooks as templates and using helper functions

 p Like the files in your <code>config</code> directory, hooks are also rendered by the Supervisor as templates using Handlebars syntax. In all templates, not only do you have acces to runtime values, you can also use custom helper functions.

 p For the complete list of helper functions, see #{link_to 'Handlebars Helpers','/docs/reference/#handlebars-helpers'}.
