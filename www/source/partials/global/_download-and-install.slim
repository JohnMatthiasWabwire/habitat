      <blockquote> Please note that support for Linux Kernel 2.x is limited. Not all core plans are available for Kernel 2.x, nor are there plans to backport all of the existing core plans to Kernel 2.x.  Kernel 2.x is legacy technology by definition, and its use should be viewed as a stop-gap to provide interim solutions for old systems, as they are upgraded to more recent versions of the Linux kernel. </blockquote>

      h4.mt-2 Installing Habitat for Windows using the dowloaded Chef Habitat package.
      p Downloaded the <code>hab</code> CLI, unzip it onto your machine. We suggest unzipping to <code>C:\habitat</code>, so that the full path to Chef Habitat is similar to <code>C:\habitat\hab-0.79.1-20190410221450-x86_64-windows</code>. If you've downloaded a more recent version of Chef Habitat, you'll see a different set of numbers following <code>hab-</code>. Replace the package name used in these examples with the filename you see on your computer. Next, add that folder to your <code>PATH</code> variable so your computer will know where to find it. Hereâ€™s how to do that with Powershell:
      = code(:powershell) do
        | $ $env:PATH += ";C:\habitat\hab-0.79.1-20190410221450-x86_64-windows\"

      p To use a Docker Chef Habitat Studio as an isolated environment, you'll also need to install Docker for Windows.
