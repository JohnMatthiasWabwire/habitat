# `build` is a built-in helper function that maps to `hab pkg exec core/hab-plan-build`
# rather than `hab pkg build` to avoid 'studio-in-studio' situations. Verify that the
# command functions. We assume that if the build succeeds (exits 0) we've passed this
# test, and leave more detailed testing to the build output to e2e tests for hab-plan-build
